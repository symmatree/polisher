# product research

For any concept with a public product (open source or commercial) that doesn't already have
a summary, produce a deep research 1-page summary of the product's basic function and
attributes, current status, main strengths and weaknesses (taking into account its age), and links to documentation, manuals, product detail pages, and reviews.
