# ASCII quotes and apostrophes only

When writing or editing any file in this repo, use **only** ASCII straight quotes and apostrophes:

- **Double quote:** ASCII 0x22 `"` — never Unicode U+201C or U+201D (curly/smart double quotes).
- **Apostrophe / single quote:** ASCII 0x27 `'` — never Unicode U+2018 or U+2019 (curly/smart single quotes).

Curly quotes break search/replace and make later edits fail. Do not use them.

**If a replace fails on a file you wrote:** Run the repo's normalizer (e.g. in facts: `polisher/.venv/bin/python polisher/facts/normalize_ascii_quotes.py <repo-path>`), then retry the replace. Do not work around the mismatch with inline scripts.
